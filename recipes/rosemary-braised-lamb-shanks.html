    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>
        Lamb shanks braised in red wine with fresh rosemary, garlic, 
        and tomatoes. Excellent served with polenta or roasted garlic 
        mashed potatoes, my family's favorite, to soak up the wonderful 
        sauce. This is a fantastic dish to make for company, as all the 
        prep work is done at the beginning. All you have to do is wait.
